# OpenPalette Explorer ðŸŽ¨

https://github.com/inacioEth/openPalette-explorer

First of all: let's make this project go to the moon!

Second, if anyone wants to contribuite, please do so, I have laid out a couple of issues with suggestions people have made on discord, so if anyone wants to contribute, leave a comment notifying you to do it, so others don't waste their time on the same feature. Always make your PR to the develop branch. If you want to work on a feature/bugfix which is not listed on the issues tab, just add it there and say you are going to work on that =)

The website is made with next.js + chakra-ui and is deployed to Vercel. All changes to the master branch are automatically deployed at the default URL (https://openpalette-explorer.vercel.app/) and changes made to the develop branch are also deployed but to another URL in which we can preview them before it goes to master.

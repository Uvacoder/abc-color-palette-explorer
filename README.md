# OpenPalette Explorer ðŸŽ¨
First of all: let's make this project go to the moon!

Second, if anyone wants to contribuite, please do so, I have laid out a couple of issues with suggestions people have made on discord, so if anyone wants to contribute, leave a comment notifying you to do it, so others don't waste their time on the same feature. Always make your PR to the develop branch.

The website is made with next.js + chakra-ui and is deployed to Vercel. All changes to the master branch are automatically deployed.
